Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems in machine learning inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute the animal brain. As such, they have been variously used in applications that require memory mapping, classification, clustering, pattern recognition etc. ANNs are one type of model for machine learning (ML) and has become relatively competitive to conventional regression and statistical models regarding usefulness \cite{ANNreview}. In most applications, artificial neural networks have been implemented in software. This presents its own benefits, due to the fact that the designer/developer does not need to know the hardware component of the application and can concentrate on the software component. However, a major disadvantage that occurs in software based ANNs is that their performances are lower with respect to execution time when compared with hardware-based ANNs.

Hardware-based ANNs have been developed and implemented as both digital and analogue circuits. While the analogue ANNs explore the nonlinear characteristics of the CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) devices, the digital component explores the implementation of large ANNs on a single FPGA device in order to overcome the calculation complexity of software implementations. As the analogue implementation tends to suffer from thermal drift, inexact computation results and lack of reprogrammability, the digital implementation is commonly used \cite{efficientDigitalImpl}.
